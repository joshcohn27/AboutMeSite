                <p class="intro">Businesses had to change a lot when the pandemic was first declared. Everyone was
                    working from home, and interactions with customers were limited.

                <h2>Remote Work</h2>
                <p>
                    Working from home was a huge adjustment for a lot of people. Once workers got accustomed
                    to their new work environment, many didn’t want to go back. Working from the comfort of their
                    own homes with no one else from the office around was really beneficial for a lot of people.
                    As a result, a lot of companies saw increased productivity. This brought up a huge debate: is
                    it worth having an office? Employees (and employers) did not want to go back to a packed,
                    distracting workspace, and employers and companies realized that having an office might not be
                    worth it. In addition, the cost of paying for an office when most felt more productive at home 
                    did not make sense.
                </p>

                <h3>What does this mean for management?</h3>
                <p>
                    Managers are usually given the role of overseeing their employees and planning out their work
                    schedule. In addition, they usually set up all of their meetings and they make sure their subordinates
                    complete their tasks on time. With employees working from home, managers lose face-to-face interaction
                    with their employees, and a lot of work is done at the workers’ pace. What’s the job of a remote
                    manager? It’s challenging to check in on progress, and their planning goes out the window. Why would
                    a company be paying someone more money to not be doing their job? The short answer is most companies
                    won’t. This could lead to higher ranking employees being laid off or reassigned, and it can make for
                    issues if the world gets fully back to life before remote work.

                <h2>Customer Interactions</h2>
                <p>
                    Another huge issue with the pandemic related to business is the interaction between the workers
                    and the customers. A lot of jobs require meeting with a client, or doing a job for someone. The
                    pandemic makes it nearly impossible to meet directly with a client, which has proven to be problematic.
                    If a worker is, for example, creating a website for someone they’ve never seen or met before, they
                    usually feel they don’t have a purpose in what they are doing. This can cause a lack of motivation,
                    and overall a worse product.

                    Businesses will have to keep adapting to new changes and norms. Each company will have different
                    needs and expectations from their employees, and workers have to be prepared for anything.

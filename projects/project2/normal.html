                <h1>What is Normal?</h1>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the pandemic, normal now has a new definition. It used to be freely
                    going outside without the fear of getting sick, or bringing a deadly disease
                    home to our loved ones. Now, it's always being cautious in public, realizing that
                    every decision we make can have a possible life or death effect on others.

                <h2>Will We Ever Get Back to the Old Normal?</h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, it's hard to see a world where covid is not an issue. According to 
                    recent studies, it's extremely likely that covid will remain in our society in some
                    capacity indefinately. So the short answer is: no. We will not get back to the "old normal"
                    anytime soon; however, this does not mean we have to live in fear forever. Vaccinations
                    and safety protocols mitigate the spread, and hopefully one day we can eliminate the 
                    virus completely.

                <h2>Changes in Schools and the Workplace</h2>
                <p>
                    As briefly discussed under the business impacts page, there are some changes that workplaces and schools
                    have made as a result of the pandemic. For example, many businesses realized there is no need for an office,
                    as most of their work can be done remotely. In addition, some schools, mainly colleges, realized 
                    that not all classes need to be in person, and some of them actually work better hybrid or fully remote.

                <h2>Positive Takeaways from a Negative Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    While there was (and still is) a lot of negatives that stemmed from the Covid-19 pandemic, a lot
                    of new positives were revealed. Some of them include us as a society being more hygenic, caring of other's needs,
                    and more united after going through a rough situation. Also, we learned that there was a lot of unnecessary spending
                    by both the average human and businesses, and we have been able to cut back on that. Finally, society
                    better understood the importance of mental health check-ups, and the world is more aware of
                    problems that so many people have to deal with every single day.

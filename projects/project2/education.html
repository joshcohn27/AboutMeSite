                    Being in person without restrictions can be crucial to child development and
                    teaching. We have seen different effects in the country between elementary schools,
                    middle/high schools, and colleges.

                <p>
                    Younger students have probably been hurt the most from learning remotely. So 
                    much of learning as a child is working hands-on with different activities and 
                    new ideas. While a positive may be younger kids are learning how to use technology, 
                    the cons outweigh the pros by a long shot. Some of the biggest issues include an 
                    increased screen time for children, classes having to teach at a slower pace, and 
                    parents having to basically go to school with their kids. Luckily, younger students 
                    were some of the first to get back in the classroom, but a lot of damage was done 
                    in the time they were essentially homeschooled.

            <div class="main2">
                <h2>Middle and High Schools</h2>
                <p>
                    Older students doing school online caused a lot of issues, though it was mainly 
                    for teachers. Because these students change classes at least once every hour of 
                    school, there were many connectivity issues, and more problems with getting class 
                    started with everyone there and listening than elementary schools. Another major 
                    issue was keeping students engaged. Middle and high school students tend to get 
                    distracted and bored much easier, and a lot of them did not pay attention in their 
                    online courses. In addition, a lot of students reported having gaming consoles in 
                    their rooms, which was a huge distraction, causing a lot of students to be playing 
                    games instead of listening to class.

                <h2>College Students</h2>
                <p>
                    College students also got greatly impacted by the pandemic. Though because college 
                    is something most people have to pay a lot of money for, students reported being more 
                    engaged in online classes. The biggest issue was teamwork. A lot of classes in college 
                    required students to work collaboratively, which is a major challenge when working online. 
                    Accountability can drop, work ethic decreases, and communication is a major challenge. 
                    A lot of schools had to adjust curriculum completely for their classes, causing students 
                    to be slightly thrown off on their paths to graduation and a job in the workforce. Along 
                    with this, classes also had to be taught at slower paces, causing a lot more students to 
                    fall behind and eventually fail the course they were taking.

                    In addition to all of the issues talked about above, we also run into problems with internet 
                    connection, and paying attention. Having to rely on an internet connection that is not 
                    consistent for everyone can cause issues with pacing in the classroom and deadlines for workers. 
                    Also, it is extremely easy to lose focus when at home, and it has been brutal for everyone involved.
